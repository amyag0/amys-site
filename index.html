							<h2>Basic Foundation</h2>
							<p>My name is Amy and I just turned 23 years old this January. I'm from Staten Island, NY and I am first generation Albanian-American.</p>
							<p>My parents came here from Albania in the early-mid 90s and, had my sister and I in the late 90s. Even though we live here, my parents
							made sure that we experienced our culture and sent us every summer growing up. Even our pet cat is from Albania!</p>

							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p>I've lived in Staten Island my whole life, except for the three years after I graduated highschool in 2017. When I graduated, I began my undergrad
							at SUNY New Paltz about 2 hours away. However, when we were hit by the pandemic, I had to come back home. Because of 
							some health issues my parents had, I made the decision to take some time off from school and start working to help my parents. Since then,
							I've been working as a group counselor for a nonprofit organization. I had the oppurtunity to work with so many different kids of many 
							different ages. However, during this time, I've also been considering my options for making the jump back into the pursuit of my career. 
							In my search, I came across engineering bootcamps. There were so many things that stood out to me that really influenced my decision to apply.</p>
						</div>

						<div id="section-3" class="section">
							<h2>Onto New Things</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Learning and applying new things at a quicker pace</li>
								<li>Consecutive classes where you're continuously learning new things</li>
								<li>Better environment for collaborating</li>
							</ul>
							<p>These factors all appealed to me because those were the very reasons I did not enjoy learning in a standard college setting. Being able to work
							along side others, while also being able to ask instructors questions about something we learned about that is being applied to a new thing the 
							very next day is more condusive to my learning. In addition, being able to move onto material that ties in something that was previously taught
							at a quicker pace is preferrable to me over the college setting I was used to where you had class once or twice a week for an hour. Overall, I 
							am very excited to see what I can learn from this experience and where it will take me.</p>

							<h2>Interests</h2>
							<p>Since my mom is very creative and my dad had a construction company, my parents always encouraged my sister and I to try our hand at fixing or
							making things. This has led to an array of projects, big and small, and sparked a lot of other interests.</p>
